access modifiers? private, public and protected
can't specify types even if you wanted to?

like
    everything is an object
    sets to remove duplicates
    lists, tuples, sets and dictionaries

fucking stupid shit
    boolean first letter needs to be uppercase
        x = True
    no braces
    no multiline comments
        can be hacked using """
        a string literal that is not assigned to a variable
    weird : after an if
    code blocks via indentation
        indentation spaces have to be the exact same in a code block as well
